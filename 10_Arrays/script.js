console.log("Hey Guys Today we look into the topic Arrays in JavaScript")
//We use Arrays when we basically wants to store many variables or values in the single Variable


// It has some operation like Stack in other languages

const Students = ["Will","Eleven","Mike","Jonathan","Robin","Dustin"]
console.log(Students) // Prints all the Array
console.log(Students[2]) //Prints value which is at 2nd index
console.log(Students.pop()) //Pop the Last Element

//It is heterogeneous in the JavaScripts which means it can store any dataType
const random = ["Vishesh",19,true,"Bml Munjal"] 

random.push("2nd Year Student")
console.log(random) // Prints all the Array
console.log(random.length) // Gives length of the Array
console.log(random.reverse()) // reverse the whole Array parmanent
console.log(random) // Checking if the Array permanatly reversed
